## Vision & Mission

### Vision

Enable collaborative simulation and model-based analysis across organizational boundaries to improve decision-making, optimize processes, and accelerate innovation in the automotive value chain.

### Mission

The Simulation KIT provides the standards, protocols, and reference implementations needed to:

- Share simulation models and results securely across company boundaries
- Enable federated simulation workflows that respect data sovereignty
- Standardize simulation data exchange formats and metadata
- Support interoperability between different simulation tools and platforms

## Business Value

### For OEMs

- **Accelerated Development**: Run collaborative simulations with suppliers to reduce development cycles
- **Better Decisions**: Access to distributed simulation capabilities improves design choices
- **Cost Reduction**: Avoid physical prototyping through virtual validation

### For Suppliers

- **Enhanced Collaboration**: Participate in joint simulation projects with customers
- **Competitive Advantage**: Demonstrate capabilities through simulation-based validation
- **Knowledge Protection**: Share simulation results while protecting proprietary models

### For Tool Providers

- **Extended Reach**: Enable your simulation tools to work in federated scenarios
- **New Markets**: Access to dataspace ecosystem and collaborative use cases
- **Standards Compliance**: Implement standardized interfaces for simulation exchange

## Use Cases

### Virtual Product Development

Enable multi-party simulation workflows where different organizations contribute specialized simulation models (crash, aerodynamics, thermal, etc.) without exposing proprietary details.

### Supply Chain Simulation

Model and simulate supply chain scenarios collaboratively to identify bottlenecks, optimize logistics, and improve resilience.

### Process Optimization

Share simulation capabilities for manufacturing process optimization across the value chain.

## Getting Started

1. **Understand the Standards**: Review the semantic models and API specifications
2. **Set Up Infrastructure**: Deploy connectors and simulation service endpoints
3. **Integrate Tools**: Connect your simulation tools to the dataspace
4. **Run Pilot**: Start with a simple collaborative simulation scenario

## Standards & Compliance

This KIT implements and builds upon:

- Catena-X Standards for data exchange
- Connector KIT for sovereign data exchange
- Digital Twin KIT for asset representation
- Industry-standard simulation data formats
